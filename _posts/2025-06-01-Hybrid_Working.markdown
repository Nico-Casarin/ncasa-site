# Good for me

I work in Milan, the economic capital of Italy. My home is 65 km away. I was born where I live now, but I had to study and eventually work in Milan.

I would love to cicling or even to walk to the office, that is located in the north suburb of Milan - far away from the city center. Unfortuntely, 65km are no joke, and not feasible as a commuting route. I would love, but I can't. The current housing situation is almost impossible to coope with. It is not a matter of sheer cash only, habits, family &friends, but mostly of human dignity. 
I would love to cycle —or even walk— to the office, which is located in the northern suburbs of Milan, far from the city center. Unfortunately, 65 km is no joke and simply not feasible as a daily commute. I would love to, but I can't. The current housing situation is nearly impossible to cope with. It's not just about money. It’s about habits, family, friends, and, above all, human dignity.

As of April 2025 housing prices are as follows[^1]:

|        | Sale | Rent  |
|--------|------|-------|
| Varese | 1544&euro;m<sup>2</sup> | 10,9 &euro;m<sup>2</sup> |
| Milano | 5073 &euro;m<sup>2</sup> | 23,6 &euro;m<sup>2</sup> |

So, roughly 50 km of distance translates into a 228% increase in sale price and a 116% increase in rent.
Interestingly, this disparity is nowhere near reflected in average income[^2]:

|    | Avg. Income |
|----|-------------|
| Varese | 26876 &euro; - before taxes|
| Milano | 36408 &euro; - before taxes |

So, while Milano's average Joe makes only about 35% more, the cost to buy a home is 228% higher, and rent is 116% higher than Varese.
