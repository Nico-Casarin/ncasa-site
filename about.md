# Who am I?

I'm Nicola, a young enthusiast with a hunger for knowledge and a constant desire to push my limits. Born and raised in Italy, I've delved into the pages of contemporary history, nurturing an insatiable curiosity along the way.

My academic journey led me to a high school diploma in environmental chemistry and a university degree in contemporary history. But I didn't stop there! I pursued a master's program in data analytics, where I discovered the incredible power of statistics in various fields.
